General Information

Being polite to others is very important, it is a sign of respect to others. And it helps with social interaction. But how has this changed over the years on social media like Twitter? This study looks at the change of the use of politeness markers on Twitter.

Background Information
---
There have been several studies about the relationship between politeness and social media. For instance, [1] interviewed a group of students and lecturers about their conception of politeness. The study also looked at the messages of the students and analysed them. [2] Another study made a survey for students about social media and politeness comunication. Both conclude that the politeness has decreased.

Research Question and Hypothesis
---
Research question: 
Has the usage of politeness markers (e.g. “please”, “thank you”) on social media (Twitter) changed over time?


Hypothesis:
The usage of politeness markers on Twitter has probably decreased over time due to the informal nature of online communication. As users have become more accustomed to communicating online, they may feel less pressure to include politeness markers in their messages, specially when interacting with people who they already know.

Method

With the corpus of Tweets from the RUG I will look at the tweets containing words like "please?" and "thank you" etc.. I will look at a timespan from 2010 until 2022. If a tweet contains such word, I will mark it as polite and then compare it to non-polite tweets. The ratio of each year will be compared to each other to see if there is a increase or decrease of politeness markers.
